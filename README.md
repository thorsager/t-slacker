# Terminal Slacker
Trying to bring the joy of [irssi](https://irssi.org) to the users of 
[slack](https://slack). No plain and simple just trying to create a new slack
client with a _twist_, It is running in a terminal, and I should try try not
to use all memory in the world.


# Disclaimer
I'm NOT a [go](https://golang.org) programmer in any way, I would like to learn
though. So If you have the time, and is thinking that "Slacking off" in a 
terminal could be great, please join and help me make this perhaps slightly
usable. -- Thanks
